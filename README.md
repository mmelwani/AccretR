# AccretR
A planetary body accretion program that calculates mass, radius and bulk composition along a growth track.

Currently, it is optimized to build Jupiter's moon Europa, and Saturn's moon Titan, from CI, CM and CV chondritic meteorites, cometary material (using comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko), and pure water ice.

Some care must be taken when selecting to accrete either Europa or Titan - simply comment out the unnecessary lines, and run in R. RStudio may be used.
