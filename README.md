# AccretR
A planetary body accretion program that calculates mass, radius and bulk composition along a growth track.

Currently, it is optimized to build Jupiter's moon Europa, and Saturn's moons Titan and Enceladus, from CI, CM, CR, CK and CV carbonaceous chondrite meteorites, cometary material (using comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko), and pure water ice.

Some care must be taken when selecting to accrete either Europa, Titan or Enceladus - simply comment out the unnecessary lines, and run in R. RStudio may be used.
